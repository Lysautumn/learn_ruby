# GitHub Challenge: Ruby

## Introduction

The GitHub Challenge is an independent learning program at Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's done in 30 day sprints. It emphasizes continuous learning by asking participants to make one GitHub commit per day in the technology they choose to study. For this sprint, I will be learning Ruby though various resources.

The first portion is exercises from Codecademy. This allows for repetition of concepts, to assist with learning. The Codecademy exercises start fairly basic with printing and variables. It then moves into if/else and unless statements. Next, it moves into operators: comparator/relational, boolean, or and not. There is then some review questions.

The next section starts with while loops.
